##### Sample scenes reference
1. **Asset Loader Sample**<br>
This sample let you load models from local storage and from URIs.<br>
Works on: Windows, OSX, Linux, UWP and Android. <br>
(Besides the sample-specific platforms, the methods used on this sample can be replicated to any platform)<br>
<br>
2. **Sync Asset Loading Sample**<br>
This sample synchronously loads a model from TriLib project folder.<br>
Works on: Windows, OSX and Linux. (Editor only sample)<br>
(Besides the sample-specific platforms, the methods used on this sample can be replicated to any platform)<br>
<br>
3. **Sync Asset Downloading Sample**<br>
This sample synchronously loads a model from a URI.<br>
Works on: All platforms.<br>
<br>
4. **Async Asset Loading Sample**<br>
This sample asynchronously loads a model from TriLib project folder.<br>
Works on: Windows, OSX and Linux. (Editor only sample)<br>
(Besides the sample-specific platforms, the methods used on this sample can be replicated to any platform, just not to WebGL)<br>
<br>
5. **Sync Batch Asset Downloading Sample**<br>
This sample let you download a series of models from TriLib server and load them. After the samples have been loaded, they're stored locally for faster loading.<br>
Works on: Windows, OSX and Linux.<br>
<br>
6. **Async Asset Downloading Sample**<br>
This sample asynchronously loads a model from a URI.<br>
Works on: Windows, OSX, Linux, UWP and Android and iOS.<br>
<br>
7. **Sync Persistent Data Path Asset Loader Sample**<br>
This sample let you load models from the device persistent data path.<br>
Works on: All platforms.<br>
<br>
8. **Custom IO Asset Loading Sample**<br>
This sample loads a model and texture from a custom data source (data is encoded on base-64 strings).<br>
Works on: All platforms.<br>
<br>
9. **Progress Handling Sample**<br>
This sample loads a model from TriLib project folder while it shows the loading progress indicator.<br>
Works on: Windows, OSX and Linux. (Editor only sample)<br>
(Besides the sample-specific platforms, the methods used on this sample can be replicated to any platform, just not to WebGL)
<br>
(**Important:**Async operations aren't supported by Unity WebGL platform at the moment.)
